# BankVis - Frontend

### A Data Visualization application for transaction data from [Simple Finance](https://simple.com)

This application is a client side application built with Angular 2. It uses an authentication and user management API, which can be found [here](https://github.com/rossedfort/bank-vis-backend), and relies on Firebase's Real Time Database for storing and retrieving transaction data. A User is required to have an account with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and set up an application. When a user signs up, they must enter the URL to their Firebase Real Time Database, and the authentication token associated with it.
